"""
analysis/regime_classifier.py — Market regime classification.
Ported from crypto_trader v3.0. BtcPersonality removed (equities context).
Added ORB_CONFIRMED as a regime that overlays TRENDING when ORB is confirmed.

v1.3 — 2026-07-09 — COVERAGE FIX: a strongly-trending tape must not fall to
        UNKNOWN. Root cause (regime_log post-mortem, 2026-07-09): during clean,
        held ORB breakouts at ADX 43–50, momentary timeframe de-alignment made
        `aligned_timeframes < 2` kick the tick out of _is_trending; BREAKOUT
        simultaneously failed on a BB re-entry flicker; nothing else matched →
        UNKNOWN → no-trade gate → five high-beta names (AMD, MU, PLTR, AMZN,
        NVDA*) fired ZERO trades on clean breakouts. (*NVDA was a deploy-timing
        casualty, not a classifier miss.)
        FIX: timeframe alignment is CORROBORATION for MARGINAL ADX, not a hard
        gate at any strength. Below ADX_STRONG_SOLO, alignment ≥ 2 is still
        required exactly as before; at/above it, ADX carries the trend on its
        own. The structure-contradiction guard and NEUTRAL-direction rejection
        are unchanged — this widens nothing except the alignment requirement
        for tape that is unambiguously strong. Contained, definitional; the
        persistence (conviction-integrator) redesign subsumes it later.
v1.2 — 2026-07-09 — base-regime definitions corrected + honest abstention.
        (a) RANGING now has POSITIVE conditions (_is_ranging: low ADX, price
            contained INSIDE the bands, not expanding) instead of being the
            silent catch-all "everything else" bucket.
        (b) UNKNOWN is now the TRUE fallback when nothing matches — the
            classifier abstains instead of forcing a RANGING label. UNKNOWN is a
            hard NO-TRADE regime, gated in the strategy dispatch (main.py): when
            regime is UNKNOWN/undefined, NO strategy may fire.
        (c) TRENDING now uses the previously-DEAD `structure` argument: a trend
            must not have CONTRADICTING structure (no LH_LL in a bull, no HH_HL
            in a bear). ADX + alignment established strength; structure confirms
            it's an actual trend and not a structureless spike.
        Definitional (fix-on-principle), not calibration.
v1.1 — 2026-07-08 — SWEEP DEFINITION CORRECTED (location + rejection). A sweep
        is not "a wick past a level." By definition it requires THREE things:
        (1) LOCATION — price at a MAPPED liquidity zone (named pool: PDH/PDL/
            session), within one expected move for the timeframe. Liquidity lives
            at the edges, not in the range interior.
        (2) PENETRATION — price pokes through the zone.
        (3) REJECTION — price is thrown back and HOLDS (reclaimed). Acceptance
            through the level is a BREAKOUT, not a sweep.
        _is_sweep_reversal now enforces all three, so sweep only OUTRANKS
        breakout/ranging when price is AT a mapped zone and rejected it. This
        removes the failure where open-air breakouts (price far above a broken
        level, no reclaim) were stamped SWEEP_REVERSAL and faded. The reclaim/
        location REQUIREMENTS are definitional; the expected-move multiple
        (SWEEP_PROXIMITY_EM) and acceptance count are calibration placeholders.
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
