analysis/regime_axes.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-07

THE CONJUNCTION, CODIFIED. Log-only. Gates nothing.

THE IDEA (operator, 2026-08-07). The regime set is not six independent states —
it is TWO ORTHOGONAL OPPOSITIONS that the argmax fuses and then throws half of
away:

    direction    TRENDING_BULL / TRENDING_BEAR  <->  RANGING
    volatility   BREAKOUT_VOLATILE              <->  COMPRESSION

Both are already scored every tick. Nothing new is measured here; this only
stops discarding one of them.

WHY IT IS NOT MERELY ELEGANT — the number that prompted it. Continuation by
regime over 12 sessions: RANGING 82 trades 51% **+$578.50**, BREAKOUT_VOL 51 49%
+$220, COMPRESSION 39 28% -$454, TRENDING_BULL 252 48% **-$3,221**,
TRENDING_BEAR 85 35% **-$4,952**. A trend-following strategy makes money ONLY
where it is not supposed to work and loses in both states it was built for.
That is what a partnership effect looks like when one label buries it.

THE SPECIFIC, FALSIFIABLE HOPE. `SETUP.nf ~= SETUP.ok` and `RGCV.nf ~= RGCV.ok`
across the whole book: neither existing score separates good trades from bad, so
no threshold on either can. **A CONJUNCTION CAN SEPARATE WHERE ITS COMPONENTS DO
NOT** — `min(a, b)` is low whenever EITHER is low, which is a different function
from anything currently computed. If the 3x3 cross-tab shows no separation
either, the idea dies cheaply and honestly.

WHY `min` AND NOT A MEAN. A mean lets a confident direction paper over an
unknown volatility state. The claim being made is "BOTH axes agree the context is
legible", and the weakest link is exactly what that means. `min` also cannot
manufacture confidence the components lack — it is bounded above by both.

⚠️ MARGIN IS REPORTED SEPARATELY AND IS NOT FOLDED IN. A winner at 0.90 against
a runner-up at 0.89 is not a confident read, but collapsing level and margin into
one number would hide which of the two is missing. The census already proved this
matters: separation looked healthy at p50 0.347 only because uncontested ticks
inflated it.

⚠️ SWEEP_REVERSAL IS ON NEITHER AXIS, deliberately. It is an EVENT OVERLAY
(MECHANICS.md:304) and left the integrated set in RGM.3. Putting it on an axis
would repeat exactly the category error that kept it losing an argmax it could
never win.

⚠️ THIS GATES NOTHING AND MUST NOT, YET. Emit, measure, then decide — the same
order as F7's shadow A/B. Anything that gates on the pair is RGM.2 Stage 3,
post-go-live.

Pure functions, stdlib only, no I/O. Safe to call every tick.
