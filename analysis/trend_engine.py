"""
analysis/trend_engine.py — Trend detection via EMA stacks, ADX, momentum.
Operates on 5m, 15m, and 1H timeframes for multi-TF trend alignment.
v1.0 — original release
v1.1 — 2026-06-30 — primary_adx now sourced from the 5m timeframe instead
        of 1H. This is a 0DTE intraday bot trading off ORB/butterfly setups
        on 5-min structure — 1H ADX lags the actual session move and was
        causing trend days to misclassify as RANGING (ADX stuck near 0
        until the 1H candle had enough history to show directional
        persistence, which can be hours after the actual breakout fired).
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
