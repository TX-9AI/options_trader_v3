"""
analysis/orb_engine.py — Opening Range Breakout state machine.
v3.2 — 2026-07-11 — ORB beats sweep under the regime switch. The retest confirm
        used to DEFER (leave the setup awaiting retest) whenever the regime was
        SWEEP_REVERSAL, so a sweep label suppressed a valid ORB. Guarded by
        config.ORB_FIRES_REGARDLESS_OF_REGIME: when on, the engine confirms OPEN
        under a sweep label and the dispatch fires ORB (ORB wins). When off,
        behaviour is unchanged (defers to sweep). Pairs with main.py v3.2, which
        admits UNKNOWN/SWEEP_REVERSAL to the ORB dispatch. No change to the v3.1
        stop logic.
v3.1 — 2026-07-11 — STOP PLACEMENT FIX + impulsive-candle origin gate.
        (1) The protective stop now anchors to the impulsive (break) candle's
            actual WICK — its LOW for a long, its HIGH for a short — not the
            body (min/max of open,close) it used before. When the impulsive
            candle opened outside the range, the body edge sat OUTSIDE the
            level, so the retest entry (which returns to the level) printed a
            stop on the wrong side of entry — inverted/degenerate risk. The
            wick is the true origin of the breakout move and sits inside the
            range where invalidation actually lives.
        (2) A valid impulsive candle must ORIGINATE INSIDE the range: its low
            must reach into the range for a long (low < orb_high), its high for
            a short (high > orb_low). A candle sitting entirely beyond the range
            is late continuation, not an ORB break; taking its "retest" was the
            source of the remaining inverted stops (fast/gap breaks and re-arms
            while price was extended). Gating on origin removes them.
        Verified on candle-logger tape (2026-07-09/10, 44 symbol-sessions):
        inverted-risk entries fell to 0 and the MU 2026-07-10 09:49/09:50
        reference setup reproduces exactly (stop 971.14 = impulsive low).
        Stop-LEVEL fix only; the exit TRIGGER is unchanged (see note below).
v3.0 — 2026-07-07 — FIX (grave): break latches broke_high/broke_low are now
        maintained UNCONDITIONALLY every tick by _update_break_latches(),
        decoupled from the RANGING-only _check_for_break() path. Previously the
        latches were set solely inside _check_for_break(), which runs ONLY in
        RANGING state — so once the engine left RANGING without re-arming
        (runaway, retest-timeout, or a confirmed OPEN), it never re-checked for
        a break and the OPPOSITE-side latch could never be set. A genuine
        opposite-side 1-min CLOSE breakout after a one-sided runaway was
        therefore invisible to the sweep-reversal gate (_sweep_broke_orb),
        BLOCKING the highest-conviction failed-breakout reversals pre-11:00 —
        and the surviving same-side latch could be leaned on while stale. The
        latch is now a pure session fact ("did a 1-min candle CLOSE beyond this
        boundary this session"), independent of ORB entry state. Preserved:
        it stays CLOSE-based (a wick that pokes and closes back inside still
        does NOT arm a sweep — the AVGO-trap protection) and latch-only (set
        True; cleared solely by reset_for_session()). Fix is contained to this
        file; downstream (sweep gate + orb_state.json) reads the properties
        unchanged.
v1.8 — 2026-07-06 — (a) session break latches broke_high/broke_low set on a
        1-min CLOSE beyond the range — these arm the sweep reversal (same break
        the ORB retest uses), so a wick poke that closes back inside no longer
        arms a sweep. (b) retest confirm DEFERS when regime==SWEEP_REVERSAL
        (sweeps take priority) so the engine can't get stuck in a phantom OPEN.
        (c) re-arm rule tightened to: 1-min close back inside AND before 11:00
        (runaway/timeout never re-arm).
v1.0 — original release
v1.1 — 2026-06-30 — full state model rewrite
v1.2 — 2026-06-30 — fix cutoff check running before range-setting
v1.3 — 2026-07-01 — ORB range now read from orb_range.json (written by
        analysis/get_orb_range.py). Single source of truth — no external feed
        calls inside the engine, no log parsing, no circular logic.
v1.4 — 2026-07-02 — fix _range_date comparison: now stored as string from
        JSON date field so today check works correctly and engine stops
        reloading orb_range.json every tick after range is set.
v1.7 — 2026-07-02 — regime-gated re-arm: after a (b) close-inside invalidation,
        re-arm and watch for another break ONLY while the regime is still
        ORB-friendly (RANGING/COMPRESSION). Do NOT re-arm after an (a) runaway
        (hand off to sweep) or once the regime has shifted to sweep/trend/
        breakout. Tracks invalidation_reason to distinguish the two.
v1.6 — 2026-07-02 — 11:00 ET HARD cutoff (expire even awaiting-retest, so the
        bot moves to other regimes after 11:00) + two explicit invalidation
        rules: (a) price runs to the 50% TP with no retest (runaway breakout,
        favors sweep reversal); (b) a 1m candle closes back inside the ORB
        range. Replaces the 2PM/exempt-retest behavior.
v1.5 — 2026-07-02 — honor the orb_range.json "status" field. Only an
        ESTABLISHED range dated today is loaded and armed (WAITING->RANGING).
        EXPIRED (last RTH) and IN_PROGRESS (opening candle still forming)
        ranges are ignored for trading, so the engine can never break out on
        a carried-over prior-day range.
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
