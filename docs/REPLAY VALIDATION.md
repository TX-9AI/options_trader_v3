# REPLAY_VALIDATION.md — Layer 1 validation & calibration plan

**v1.1 — 2026-07-13.** Companion to `tests/replay_confluence.py` v1.0 and
`analysis/regime_confluence.py` v1.0 / `REGIME_TRUTHS.md` v0.2. Closes ROADMAP
Phase 1 (finish the regime truths) by making the scorer replayable and stating what
Layer-1 acceptance means — **without invoking any Layer-2 behavior** (no conviction,
no commit, no hysteresis; instantaneous scores only).

---

## 1. Method — why replay, and why over the DXFeed CSVs

The scorer is validated and calibrated by **replay over the candle logger's DXFeed
1-min OHLC** (`data/OHLC/<date>/<SYMBOL>.csv`), **not** the shadow observer's
`data/shadow/<date>/<SYMBOL>.jsonl`.

**Corrected premise (v1.1).** Earlier revisions justified this by claiming the
observer "scores off yfinance" and was therefore a divergent feed. **That is false,
and was false when written.** `shadow/observer.py` acquires data through exactly one
call — `get_cache(symbol)` → `data/data_cache.py` → `data/market_data.py` — and since
the v3.0 purge `market_data` reads the on-box shared SQLite store written by
`data/candle_feed.py` (TastyTrade/DXFeed), read-only, heartbeat-guarded. There is no
yfinance anywhere in the repo and none in `requirements.txt`. **The observer scores off
the same DXFeed tape the CSVs are cut from.** The old rationale would send an agent off
to "re-purge" code that is already clean.

**The real reason to prefer the CSVs is sampling, not source.** Same tape, different
sampling of it:

| | shadow jsonl | DXFeed CSVs |
|---|---|---|
| cadence | every `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, wall-clock | fixed 1-min bars |
| freshness | staleness-gated cache; a frame may be re-read across ticks, or served as `None` past the hard-stale ceiling | every bar present exactly once |
| reproducibility | depends on tick timing, restarts, staleness state | deterministic — same input, same output, forever |

Calibration needs a **deterministic, evenly-sampled substrate**, which is the CSVs. The
observer's log is an *operational* record of what the live scorer actually saw, which is
a different and also useful thing — but it is not a calibration surface. The CSVs also
already accumulate fleet-wide on every box, so no fleet observer deployment is required.

**As-of replay.** For each 1-min bar *t* of a session the harness slices every
timeframe frame to bars ≤ *t*, runs the **real** engines
(`volatility/trend/structure/liquidity_engine.analyze()` — the same code the live
bot runs, not a reimplementation), and scores the resulting state objects with the
real `RegimeConfluenceScorer`. It optionally also runs the v1.3 boolean classifier
on the same states for a side-by-side label. This reconstructs, bar by bar, exactly
what the live scorer would have seen — so the factor distributions it produces are
the genuine calibration surface, not a proxy.

**Run:**
```
python -m tests.replay_confluence data/OHLC/2026-07-13            # a whole session dir
python -m tests.replay_confluence data/OHLC/2026-07-13/SPX.csv    # one symbol
        [--warmup 20] [--jsonl out.jsonl] [--no-v13]
```
Isolation: reads OHLC + runs engines only; no orders, no `trades.db`, writes only the
report (+ optional `--jsonl`). Safe to run anytime, including mid-RTH (read-only).

## 2. Acceptance — two tiers

### Tier A — structural invariants (label-free; must hold on ANY replay)

These validate the scorer's *logic* and need no labeled tape. Implemented as the
harness's acceptance block; **all five pass on the 07-09/07-10 sample.**

| # | invariant | rationale | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | every score ∈ [0,1] or None | grammar bound; None only when inputs unreadable | ✅ |
| A2 | TRENDING & RANGING never both > 0.5 | the flat-angle master veto is mutually exclusive | ✅ |
| A3 | BREAKOUT & COMPRESSION never both > 0.5 | opposite ends of the width axis | ✅ |
| A4 | no TRENDING_BULL > 0 under LH_LL structure | the structure-contradiction hard veto | ✅ |
| A5 | all-zero ("would-be UNKNOWN") ticks < 15% | Task 2 — indecision is low score, not abstention | ✅ (13%) |

A1–A4 are permanent regression guards — any future change that breaks one is a
definitional error. A5 is a calibration-sensitive target (see §4): the all-zero
residual should *fall* as the flat cut is fit, because most all-zero ticks are ranges
over-vetoed by too-low an angle cut.

### Tier B — labeled-behavior criteria (need known session types; the RTH targets)

These validate that each regime *fires on its own tape*. Each needs a session (or
window) whose type is known from independent evidence — the eye, the v1.3 log, the
liquidity mapper's own sweep verdict, or a documented post-mortem episode. Thresholds
are PRIOR. **This table is the "make the most of the next RTH" checklist** — each row
names the tape to capture and the bar it must clear.

| regime | acceptance criterion (Layer-1, instantaneous) | tape needed | PRIOR bar | have it? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RANGING** | on a shark-fin/chop session, RANGING is the dominant nonzero score on ≥ X% of mid-session ticks | 07-09 autopsy day | X ≈ 60% | ✅ **64% dom** |
| **COMPRESSION** | on a coil-into-pin session, COMPRESSION rises relative to RANGING through the final hour (energy-bleed arc) | a QQQ/SPX pin day | Δdom > 0 AM→PM | partial (need a clean pin) |
| **BREAKOUT** | on the 07-09 clean-breakout names, BREAKOUT stays > 0 through the BB re-entry flicker at ADX 43–50 (momentum carry) | AMD/MU/PLTR/AMZN 07-09 | > 0 across flicker | partial (have MU/NVDA) |
| **TRENDING** | on a genuine trend day, TRENDING_* dominant ≥ X% and RANGING vetoed through it | **a real trend day (missing)** | X ≈ 50% | ❌ **tape gap** |
| **SWEEP** | at a mapper-confirmed named-zone reclaim, SWEEP > 0 at the sweep bar and decays over ~3 bars absent follow-through | a session with a confirmed sweep | > 0 at bar, decays | ❌ none in sample |

**The tape gaps are the RTH shopping list.** TRENDING cannot be validated on any tape
we hold — every session so far is chop/flat (the same confound that shelved GRIND).
Monday, capture and label: (a) any symbol that trends cleanly, (b) any that coils into
a pin, (c) any mapper-flagged sweep. Those three fill the table.

## 3. First-light findings (07-09 fleet slice + 07-10 SPX, 2595 ticks)

Real numbers from the real engines — treat as directional, not settled (all chop/flat
tape; see gaps above):

- **RANGING claims the chop, as designed.** 76–78% of ticks score RANGING > 0, 62–64%
  dominant. This is the system doing what the 07-09 autopsy said it *should* — claiming
  energetic mean-reverting chop as RANGING instead of dwelling in UNKNOWN. The single
  biggest v1.x failure mode is closed on this tape.
- **UNKNOWN reclamation is real.** The v1.3 classifier labeled 566 of these ticks
  UNKNOWN; the scorer assigns them to RANGING/COMPRESSION. The 62% L1-vs-v1.3 label
  agreement is *mostly this designed disagreement*, not error.
- **TRENDING scored 0% everywhere — and so did v1.3** (its label set here is only
  RANGING/COMPRESSION/UNKNOWN). Consistent, not a bug: there is no trend tape in the
  sample. Cannot validate the TRENDING factors until we have a trend day.
- **SWEEP scored 0%** — no mapper-confirmed named-zone reclaim in the sample. Cannot
  validate SWEEP yet.

## 4. Calibration — the factor-distribution report

The harness prints each regime's score distribution and, the calibration payload,
**the flat-angle distribution split by v1.3 label**. First-light (single/few days, so
angles run hot exactly as the persistence design predicted):

| v1.3 label | n | p10 | p50 | p90 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RANGING | 1150 | 2.4° | 10.2° | **22.1°** | 37.2° |
| COMPRESSION | 851 | 1.8° | 9.6° | 19.1° | 38.8° |
| UNKNOWN | 566 | 2.7° | 13.5° | 29.0° | 38.6° |

**The #1 calibration finding:** `FLAT_ANGLE_CUT_DEG = 20°` looks **too low**. Ticks
that v1.3 (and the eye) call RANGING have a p90 of **22°** — so > 10% of genuine ranges
sit *above* our veto and get zeroed. This is precisely the "one day clusters everyone
at 24–32°, needs multi-day base rates" warning, now quantified. Do **not** just raise
the cut off one sample — the correct move is the documented sweep of 16–26° against
multi-day labeled windows; but the direction is clear and it explains A5's 13%
all-zero residual (ranges over-vetoed into silence). RANGING and COMPRESSION angle
distributions overlap (both flat, as they should); UNKNOWN skews higher (transitional).

Every PRIOR in `REGIME_TRUTHS.md` §4 gets a distribution column this way as labeled
tape accumulates: the ADX ramps from TRENDING/BREAKOUT onset ticks, the crossings ramp
from confirmed ranges, the compression width ramp and RANGE_ROOM span from the
squeeze-vs-range split, the sweep rejection ramp and half-life from confirmed sweeps.

---

## 5. Circularity guard (non-negotiable)

Truths tuned and thresholds calibrated on the *same* sessions look beautiful and mean
nothing. **Split the tape:** the sessions used to fit `FLAT_ANGLE_CUT_DEG` (and every
other knob) must not be the sessions used to run Tier-B acceptance. Practically: as the
store accumulates, hold out a rotating ~30% of sessions as the acceptance set, fit on
the rest, and re-check. A knob that only validates on its own fit set is unproven.

---

## 6. Known limitations

- **Volume-less index tape.** Cash SPX logs `volume = 0`, making the engine VWAP a 0/0
  NaN (warning suppressed in the harness). Our scorer reads `price_vs_bb`, not VWAP, so
  scores are unaffected — but any *future* VWAP-based factor is unreliable for index
  symbols and must guard for it.
- **Chop-only sample.** Every session held so far is chop/flat. TRENDING and SWEEP are
  structurally unvalidatable until trend/sweep tape is captured (§2 Tier B).
- **As-of boundary effects.** Timeframe frames are sliced at `index ≤ t`; a partially
  formed current higher-TF bar is excluded rather than half-counted. Conservative and
  deterministic; matches how a live tick sees closed bars.
- **Single-instance engines.** The harness reuses one engine singleton set across all
  symbols; engines are stateless across `.analyze()` calls (verified: they return fresh
  state objects), so cross-symbol contamination is not possible — but keep it in mind if
  an engine ever caches per-symbol.

## 7. Monday workflow (the RTH plan)

1. Let the candle logger record as usual — no observer deployment needed for this.
2. EOD, pull the session dir and run: `python -m tests.replay_confluence
   data/OHLC/<date> --jsonl data/shadow/replay_<date>.jsonl`.
3. Read the report: Tier-A must stay 5/5; note RANGING dominance and the all-zero %.
4. **Label the day's exceptional symbols** (trend / coil-pin / sweep) and file which
   sessions fill the Tier-B gaps.
5. Append the flat-angle-by-label rows to the accumulating calibration set. Only sweep
   the cut once ≥ several distinct sessions are in — never off one day.
6. When a trend day and a confirmed sweep are in hand, Tier B can complete and the
   PRIORs graduate to VALIDATED — at which point the scorer is calibration-ready and
   the Phase-0 integrator port (Layer 2) can begin against real evidence distributions.
