main.py — options_trader v3.8
v3.8 — 2026-07-15 — pass df_5m through to position management so exit trails
        anchor to 5-minute FVGs (exit_engine v3.8 runner refinements).
v3.7 — 2026-07-15 — CONDOR ENTRY FILL-CONFIRMATION (audit defect O, part 1).
        _execute_condor_leg live path now confirms the fill before ANY record
        exists: submit the signed-credit limit → poll via
        execution/order_confirm.confirm_order_fill (bounded by
        LIVE_ENTRY_DEADLINE_SECONDS) → book ONLY confirmed contracts at the
        broker's per-leg net credit. Unfilled → cancel, walk away, no ghost;
        partial → book the filled size; uncancellable → page, reconcile adopts.
        notify_leg_filled() therefore advances the legging state machine only
        on real fills. PAPER mirrors live friction: condor credit now applies
        PAPER_FILL_SLIPPAGE_PCT (it previously ignored the knob and filled at
        exact mid). price_effect kwarg dropped (ignored by SDK; sign carries
        the credit).
v3.6 — 2026-07-15 — PHANTOM P&L RECOVERY + denser reconcile schedule.
        (a) A phantom (DB open, broker flat — e.g. a manual close at the broker)
            now books its REAL fill: one order-history read per reconcile pass,
            match_closing_fills() finds the closing order(s), phantom_pnl()
            books credit-signed truth into the DB (which DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT
            reads). No matching order (expiry/assignment) -> flagged $0.00 as
            before. Applies to BOTH the startup reconcile (history covers back
            to each phantom's entry date) and intraday sweeps.
        (b) Intraday sweeps every BROKER_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MIN (default 10,
            was hardcoded 30), PLUS wind-down sweeps at 15:45, 15:50, and a
            final 15:57 post-flatten truth pass (last guaranteed look before
            the loop goes dormant at 16:00).
        (c) Phantom alerts now carry the recovered P&L.
v3.4 — 2026-07-15 — Condor legs now record |short-strike delta| as setup_score
        (a calibration "street-sign", read AFTER the BB-anchored selector
        picks the strike — it does NOT influence selection or sizing). NULL
        when the Greeks feed did not populate delta, so a stored value is
        always a genuine delta. Enables later condor threshold calibration;
        previously condor legs logged no score at all.
v3.4 — 2026-07-15 — handle_hard_close() now fetches the options chain once and
        passes it to flatten_all(), so the 15:45 force-flatten has real marks
        (paper fill price / live context) instead of booking at entry premium
        and logging every leg at +$0.00. Reused across the 15:45->16:00 retries.
v3.3 — 2026-07-13 — defect H rename only: NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET -> ORB_NO_ENTRY_AFTER_ET
        (import + the orb_state.json "past_cutoff" flag). Same constant, same
        (11, 0) value, same behaviour — the name now states its ORB scope.
v3.2 — 2026-07-11 — REGIME UN-GATE for the flagship ORB (config-switched,
        ORB_FIRES_REGARDLESS_OF_REGIME, default on). A confirmed ORB break+retest
        now fires regardless of the regime label — including UNKNOWN and
        SWEEP_REVERSAL — because the ORB engine's break+retest is self-validating
        and the classifier does not test for it. Two changes in run_entry_logic:
        (1) the hard UNKNOWN gate is bypassed when the engine is in a confirmed
            OPEN state (the label no longer vetoes a proven setup);
        (2) the ORB dispatch admits UNKNOWN and SWEEP_REVERSAL (ORB beats sweep;
            engine no longer defers OPEN under a sweep — see orb_engine v3.2).
        Nothing else loosens: sweep/butterfly/condor still self-gate on their own
        regime values, and the setup scorer's B-threshold still governs (under
        UNKNOWN the regime_conviction dimension just contributes 0). Set the flag
        False to restore strict v2 gating. Every ORB fired under UNKNOWN is logged
        regime=UNKNOWN — labeled tape for the shadow observer.
v3.1 — 2026-07-10 — condor leg ENTRY alert now names the instrument. The leg-
        filled Telegram alert was built with a raw _send() that omitted the
        symbol (every other entry alert routes through the structured methods
        that already include it), so condor entries read "[PAPER] Condor Leg 2
        …" with no way to tell which box fired. Added {INSTRUMENT} after the
        mode, matching the "[MODE] SYMBOL | …" form of the other alerts. DB
        logging already recorded the symbol; this was display-only.
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
v2.13 — 2026-07-07 — INTRADAY broker reconcile (LIVE + enabled): every 30 min
        across RTH with the last sweep at 15:30, a leg-role-aware check catches
        positions the broker closed mid-session — especially a SHORT leg
        auto-closed while the long remains (loud alarm, close the broken record,
        adopt the surviving long so the 15:45 flatten handles it cleanly). Only
        inspects rows we already manage; fail-safe on a bad/empty read.
v2.12 — 2026-07-07 — LIVE broker reconciliation wired into recovery: the broker
        is the source of truth for existence. _reconcile_with_broker() queries
        open positions, KEEPs DB-planned rows confirmed there, ADOPTs+journals
        broker positions with no DB plan (managed by the ADOPTED exit path),
        and closes PHANTOM DB rows the broker no longer shows. FAIL-SAFE: a
        failed or empty broker read never closes anything — falls back to
        DB-only recovery. Paper is unchanged (no broker query).
v2.11 — 2026-07-07 — durable 15:45 flatten + expiry-aware recovery. handle_hard_
        close now routes through pos_mgr.flatten_all() so EVERY open record
        (both condor legs) is truly closed in the DB + P&L booked (the old path
        called place_exit_order directly and never wrote status='closed'),
        retries every tick to 16:00, and pages once on failure. Startup recovery
        keys on EXPIRY, not entry date (the bot trades weeklies): sweep only
        genuinely expired orphans, resume every still-live row, and flag a
        CARRIED-overnight position. Restart alerts self-identify (box symbol +
        fresh-boot vs service-restart from /proc/uptime).
v2.10 — 2026-07-02 — directional-only instruments (single names): skip iron
        condor and butterfly in the dispatch; ORB + sweep only.
v2.9 — 2026-07-02 — block new entries when the daily loss halt is active
        (day P&L <= -DAILY_LOSS_LIMIT_USD); open positions still exit.
v2.8 — 2026-07-02 — (2a) ORB-window sweep override: when an ORB signal fires but
        a sweep reversal has higher conviction, take the sweep. (2b) pass the
        current regime into the ORB engine for regime-gated re-arm. (#3) run
        the broken-wing roll check when both condor verticals are open.
v2.7 — 2026-07-02 — condor legs are now TRACKED positions: each vertical is
        sized at half the grade budget, written to the trade log, registered
        with the position manager (the only two-position strategy), and
        managed/exited per-side. Replaces the phantom notify-only path.
v2.6 — 2026-07-02 — session loss limit forces a regime reassessment instead of
        halting: main_loop consumes RiskManager.consume_reassess_request() and
        reclassifies with trigger="loss_limit".
v2.5 — 2026-07-02 — ORB range is now three-state (ESTABLISHED/IN_PROGRESS/
        EXPIRED) and always carries the last valid range. Startup fetch runs
        unconditionally (populates last-valid EXPIRED range pre-open); the
        open-poll runs from 9:30 ET and latches only when today's range is
        ESTABLISHED. Flag renamed orb_range_fetched_today -> _established_.
v2.4 — 2026-07-02 — remove duplicate _execute_condor_leg (dead 2-arg def shadowed by
        a broken 3-arg def that referenced a non-existent CondorLeg class and
        mark_leg_filled method); single canonical impl on the real OptionsSignal
        API with live TastyTrade placement ported in. ORB range fetch is now
        success-keyed (retries until today's 9:30-9:35 candle is really written)
        and the startup fetch is gated to >= 9:35 ET so it never writes a
        stale prior-day range; instrument read from OT_INSTRUMENT (no systemd
        unit-file parsing).
v2.3 — 2026-07-02 — fix missing ZoneInfo import causing loop error every tick
v2.2 — 2026-07-01 — iron condor legged entry, BB-anchored strikes,
        regime-flip exits, ORB range via get_orb_range.py/orb_range.json,
        fed day trading enabled, ORB cutoff 11AM, condor window 11AM-2PM
v1.0 — original release

0DTE options bot: ORB, Sweep Reversal, Butterfly
RTH only (9:30–16:00 ET), hard close 15:45 ET.
Run modes:
  python main.py            — interactive startup (prompts instrument, risk $, paper/live)
