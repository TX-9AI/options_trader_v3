"""
execution/broker_reconcile.py — LIVE broker⇄DB position reconciliation.
v3.0 — 2026-07-07 — initial: the brokerage is the source of truth for whether a
        position EXISTS; the DB supplies the management plan. Builds a plan of
        keep / adopt / close-phantom / anomaly from broker positions + DB live
        rows. Pure logic (no SDK, no DB writes) so it is fully unit-testable; the
        caller performs the DB writes and alerts. PAPER never calls this — the DB
        is truth there.
v1.1 — 2026-07-07 — leg_roles(): split a record's option symbols into (short,
        long) so an intraday reconcile can detect a broker-closed SHORT leg
        while the long remains (build_plan only checks any-leg presence).
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.

Rules (agreed design):
  - A broker position already represented by a LIVE DB row  -> KEEP (manage from
    the existing plan).
  - A broker position with NO DB plan                       -> ADOPT and manage
    on its own merit: entry = broker average_open_price, side from the broker,
    stop = entry * (1 ∓ ADOPTED_STOP_PCT), managed by the generic adopted exit.
  - A LIVE DB row with NO matching broker position          -> PHANTOM: close it
    (broker wins on existence).
  - Pairing is for LABELLING only: a short leg with a matching long (same
    underlying+expiry+type) is tagged as part of a spread; a short with no such
    long is flagged an ANOMALY (per the account's margin reality a naked short
    should be near-impossible) — but it is still adopted and managed, loudly.
