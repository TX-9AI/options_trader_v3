"""
strategy/iron_condor_strategy.py — Legged Iron Condor for RANGING regime.
v3.1 — 2026-07-12 — FIX missing import (latent since v1.0, 2026-06-30):
        OptionContract/OptionsChain were referenced in CondorPlan's dataclass
        annotations and in method signatures but never imported. Python 3.14's
        lazy annotation evaluation (PEP 649) masked it on the fleet; on any
        Python <= 3.13 the module raises NameError at import, which kills
        main.py at startup (verified 3.12 vs 3.14 A/B on the identical tree).
        One import line added, matching the canonical form used by
        base_strategy.py and gex_data.py. No logic change.
v3.0 — 2026-06-30 — initial release (simultaneous entry placeholder)
v1.1 — 2026-06-30 — full redesign: legged entry via price-triggered verticals.
v1.2 — 2026-07-02 — docstring/comment cleanup: strike selection is BB-band
        anchored ONLY (no delta anywhere in the code). Removed stale
        "delta-primary" / "delta as secondary" / "falls back to delta-primary"
        wording that contradicted the implementation and the architecture
        decision. No logic change.
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.

Strategy design:
  At decision time, the bot identifies both vertical spread strike locations
  by anchoring the short strikes to the Bollinger Band boundaries (short call
  at/just outside the BB upper band, short put at/just outside the BB lower
  band), with an ATM straddle-based expected-move sanity guardrail. No delta
  targeting is used. No order is placed yet.

  Leg 1 fires when price reaches within CONDOR_PROXIMITY_STRIKES of the
  first side's short strike — whichever side price is moving toward first.
  (e.g. short call at 7545 → leg 1 fires when price hits 7540, 2 strikes away)

  Leg 2 is queued after Leg 1 fills. It fires when price reaches within
  CONDOR_PROXIMITY_STRIKES of the opposite side's short strike.

  Invalidation: if regime flips away from RANGING (to ANY other regime)
  before a leg fires, that pending leg is permanently cancelled. An
  already-filled leg stays open and manages independently — it is NEVER
  cancelled after the order is placed.

  Exit per leg: 25% stop loss OR close at $0.05 (nickel) — whichever
  comes first. No take-profit target, no trail, no BOS. Hold to nickel
  or stop, independently per leg.

  If Leg 2 never fires (price never approached the second side before
  close), Leg 1 remains as a standalone vertical and manages the same way.

State machine:
  IDLE -> DECIDED (both strikes identified, watching for Leg 1 trigger)
       -> LEG1_TRIGGERED (Leg 1 order placed, waiting for fill)
       -> LEG1_FILLED (Leg 1 live, Leg 2 queued, watching for Leg 2 trigger)
       -> LEG2_TRIGGERED (Leg 2 order placed, waiting for fill)
       -> COMPLETE (both legs filled — full iron condor assembled)
  Any state -> CANCELLED (regime flipped before a pending leg fired)
