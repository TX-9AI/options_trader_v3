tests/veto_attribution.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-06

WHICH VETO IS CAUSING THE CHURN? For every tick where a regime's score crosses
between ZERO and NON-ZERO, reports which hard veto changed state.

WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT QUESTION. The scoring grammar is multiplicative and
documented in regime_confluence's own header:

    score_R = (∏ hard_veto ∈{0,1}) · (∏ soft_necessary ∈[0,1]) · (Σ w·corroborator)

A single hard veto at 0 zeroes the whole regime, however strong every
corroborator is. That is why 64-96% of all scores are EXACTLY 0.00 across 19
sessions — not missing data and not weak signal: a veto fired.

WHICH MEANS A REGIME TRANSITION IS A BOOLEAN FLIPPING, NOT A SCORE CROSSING.
That explains why the switching-cost sweep (regime_switch_cost v1.1) decayed
gradually instead of cliffing: a delta asks the challenger to beat the incumbent
by a margin, but the incumbent did not lose by a margin — it was vetoed to zero,
and any challenger above delta clears it. **Hysteresis cannot fight a boolean.**

It also explains why re-weighting corroborators would change little: the weights
live in the LAST term, which is multiplied by zero on the majority of ticks.

WHAT A RESULT LOOKS LIKE. If one or two vetoes account for most transitions,
that is a specific and fixable target — and the candidate fix is to make that
veto a SOFT DAMPER (a value in [0,1] that reduces the score) rather than a HARD
GATE (a boolean that annihilates it). A damper degrades; a gate teleports.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SHOW. It does not say the veto is WRONG. A veto that fires
often may be correctly describing a condition that genuinely comes and goes —
`veto_inside` on a band, for instance. Whether softening it improves OUTCOMES
needs the trade join, and this tool cannot answer that. It localises the churn;
it does not license a change.

Read-only, stdlib only, streams one file at a time (v1.0 of two earlier tools in
this repo were OOM-killed by loading the whole corpus — see regime_switch_cost).
