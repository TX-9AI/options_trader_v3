tests/vwap_orientation_ledger.py — v1.4 — 2026-08-08

v1.4 — 2026-08-08 — THE JOIN LAYER, the fifth and final one — and this time the
       WHOLE remaining path was traced before anything was patched. v1.3's run
       (39,344 records) surfaced three stacked defects, none of them the filter:
       (1) DIRECTION EXISTS ON ONLY ONE TRACK. `readiness.factors.dir` is
           journaled ONLY by `_trend_credit_spread` (trade_readiness.py:569).
           Continuation (:331), sweep (:352), condor (:393 — has `side`, not
           `dir`) and butterfly (:414) journal NO direction field. So five of
           six strategies fell to `aligned() -> None` and 30,565 records were
           dumped into "undecidable" under a label that blamed the index/NONE
           case. The only strategy in the output table — TREND_CREDIT_SPREAD,
           7,201 signals — is the only track that carries `dir`. `discover()`
           compounded it: one TCS record made `readiness.factors.dir` print as
           found, masking that it is dead for the five strategies item E is
           actually about.
       (2) THE TRADE JOIN COULD NEVER MATCH. Journal groups key on track slugs
           (CONTINUATION, SWEEP, CONDOR_CALL...) while trade rows carry class
           names (ContinuationStrategy, SweepReversal, IronCondorStrategy...).
           Uppercasing both sides never makes SWEEPREVERSAL equal SWEEP, so
           `pnl_by` matched nothing — 304 trade rows, zero joined.
       (3) AND THE ONE DECIDABLE STRATEGY CANNOT HAVE TRADES. TCS's firing
           engine (vertical_spread_strategy.py) does not exist yet (v1.3 header,
           TC.4), so its 0-trade INSUFFICIENT verdict was arithmetically forced.
       FIXES: per-strategy DIRECTION RESOLVER (TCS from factors.dir;
       continuation from factors.label exactly as the emitter's own staged-pick
       path derives it, trade_readiness.py:763; condor_call -> SHORT and
       condor_put -> LONG on mechanism — a credit side's exposure is against
       the move toward it, NOT the call=long/put=short option-buyer reading;
       sweep from `staged.direction` on readiness_staged_pick rows, paired with
       the last market snapshot seen on that symbol within SNAP_MAX_AGE_S;
       butterfly undecidable BY DESIGN). Family-normalised trade join with
       condor legs attributed per side via setup_type. Undecidable is now
       REPORTED BY CAUSE so the counter can never lie about what it holds
       again, and unmatched trades are printed with their reason (ORB has no
       readiness track by design; ADOPTED rows have no signal ancestry).

v1.3 — 2026-08-08 — THE EVENT FILTER, the fourth layer. v1.2 resolved all five
       fields correctly and the run STILL returned 419 undecidable and ZERO
       decidable. Cause: the event whitelist accepted only
       ("scored","fired","entry","entered") — names predating trade_readiness
       v1.5 — while the records carrying `readiness.market` are named
       `readiness`, `readiness_would_fire` and `readiness_staged_pick`. On
       2026-08-06 alone that is 11,584 records skipped before their VWAP side
       was read; the 419 survivors were `scored` rows with no market section.
       The data was never missing: BELOW 5,058 / ABOVE 3,912 that same day.
       Now PREFIX-matched on `readiness*` rather than enumerated — an exact list
       is precisely what kept this tool three versions behind its own emitter.
       ⚠️ THE LESSON, and it cost four versions: I patched the layer that had
       just failed, four times, instead of tracing the whole path once. Field
       names, then depth, then paths, then the filter. Each fix was correct and
       each was one layer short.

v1.2 — 2026-08-08 — PATHS VERIFIED AGAINST THE EMITTER. v1.1 made discovery
       path-aware, which was necessary but not sufficient: I then GUESSED the
       paths (`vwap.vwap`, `factors.dir`) and the tool found neither across
       39,344 records. Reading `trade_readiness._journal()` settles it — it
       emits ONE section, `readiness=`, holding `market` and `factors`, so
       everything is TWO levels deep: `readiness.market.vwap`,
       `readiness.market.price_vs_vwap`, `readiness.factors.dir`. The field
       NAMES in the standing note were right; the DEPTH was wrong, which is why
       two flat renames and one shallow path all missed.
       There is NO price field — `dist_pct` replaces it and is better, being
       comparable across symbols.
       ⚠️ THE TOOL EARNED ITS KEEP HERE: it printed "(NOT FOUND)" per field and
       REFUSED rather than producing an empty ledger. A silent zero-row report
       would have read as "no misorientation" instead of "wrong key".

v1.1 — 2026-08-07 — PATH-AWARE DISCOVERY. This tool exited rc=1 for two nights
       against a schema that had never landed, and the diagnosis "three field
       renames" was wrong. `_first_key` tested `n in rec` — TOP-LEVEL keys only
       — while the journal nests these under sections: `readiness.strategy` and
       `factors.dir`. **No flat rename could have reached them.** CAND entries
       may now be DOTTED PATHS and every accessor goes through `dig()`, so the
       next schema section costs one tuple entry instead of another dead tool.
       Also added `pnl_usd`, which is what the trades table actually calls it.
       ⚠️ trade_readiness v1.5 (2026-08-05) is what began emitting
       `{vwap, price_vs_vwap, dist_pct}` at all — before it, VWAP was computed
       every tick by volatility_engine and NEVER WRITTEN DOWN. So this tool can
       only see sessions from that bake forward; earlier journals have no VWAP
       to read and their absence is not a finding.

WHAT THIS ANSWERS
    Backlog item E proposes a VWAP_FILTER_ACTIVE HARD GATE across the scored
    strategies: short requires price <= VWAP, long requires price >= VWAP.
    This tool asks the only question that should decide it — per strategy, would
    that gate have blocked winners or losers?

WHY PER STRATEGY, NOT FLEET-WIDE
    VWAP alignment is a TREND-FOLLOWING filter. Sweep Reversal is a MEAN-
    REVERSION strategy: it enters counter to an extension by design, so a long
    after a downside sweep is very likely BELOW VWAP at entry. A global gate
    would veto that setup structurally, not occasionally. Continuation is the
    opposite case — alignment is exactly what it wants. One number cannot serve
    both, which is why the output is split by strategy x direction x alignment
    and never aggregated into a single verdict.

THE RULE THIS TOOL OBEYS  (design principle, 2026-07-30)
    Outcomes may FALSIFY, never FIT. This prints evidence that a factor looks
    correctly or incorrectly ORIENTED for a given strategy. It does NOT emit a
    weight, a threshold, or a suggested value, and nothing in the live path
    reads its output. A verdict's only permitted next step is a design review
    whose conclusion must be justifiable on MECHANISM — "this is a trend filter
    on a reversion strategy" — not on the P&L that flagged it.

SAMPLE DISCIPLINE
    Small samples produce spurious signs. Any cell below MIN_CELL is printed as
    INSUFFICIENT and never given a verdict. One good session is not evidence.
