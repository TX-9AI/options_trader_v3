tests/adx_reconstruct.py — v1.1 — 2026-08-03

v1.1 — 2026-08-03 — --db ACCEPTS A DIRECTORY. v1.0 took a single file, on the
       assumption there was one trades.db. There is not: the fleet pulls to
       `~/day_trader_pro/trades/<date>/<SYM>_trades_<date>.db` — one db PER SYMBOL
       per pull. The per-db join was already right (each box's db holds exactly
       one symbol, which is why regime_log needs no symbol column); it just had to
       walk the tree. Given a directory, every .db under it is processed
       independently and the overlap bar is evaluated PER DB — one symbol failing
       its own held-out check does not block the others, and does not get written.

BACKFILL `adx_at_entry` ON PRE-2026-07-27 TRADE ROWS by timestamp-joining
`regime_log` to `trades`. Backlog item: "Historical ADX reconstruction",
deferred at the 07-24 fix and worth doing now that the warm rebuild has landed.

WHAT THIS UNBLOCKS
    `adx_at_entry` arrived with the v-obs migration on 2026-07-24, so rows before
    that carry the schema default 0.0 rather than a real reading. Every study
    that wants to condition on trend strength at entry — and after the 08-03
    gap-day session that is a live question — silently treats those rows as
    ADX=0 or drops them. Reconstructing lengthens the usable sample without
    collecting anything new.

THE JOIN, and why nearest-PRECEDING rather than nearest
    For each trade, take the regime_log row with the LARGEST `logged_at` that is
    <= the trade's `entry_time`, same db, tolerance <= 60s. Nearest-preceding, not
    nearest-absolute: a regime row stamped AFTER the entry describes a world the
    trade could not have seen, and joining to it would leak hindsight into a
    column that is supposed to record what was known at the moment of entry. That
    is the same look-ahead error `a2_rail_drift`'s --persistent-only had, and it
    is worth not repeating.

TOLERANCE
    60s, per the item. regime_log writes on the tick cadence, so a gap wider than
    that means the nearest row genuinely describes a different moment. Rows with
    no match inside tolerance are LEFT ALONE — not filled with a best guess.

PROVENANCE — every written row is tagged
    Reconstructed values go in with `notes` gaining a `source=reconstructed`
    marker, so a later reader can always separate measured from inferred. A
    backfilled column that cannot be distinguished from a live one is a trap: the
    next person to find a surprising ADX distribution has no way to tell whether
    it is the market or the backfill.

THE VALIDATION IS FREE, and it is the reason to trust the result
    Rows since 2026-07-27 carry a REAL adx_at_entry. Run the identical join
    against those and compare the reconstruction to the recorded value. That is a
    held-out check costing nothing, and it measures the join rather than assuming
    it. `--verify-only` runs exactly that and writes nothing.
    **If the overlap does not agree, the backfill does not run.** Agreement is
    defined up front as median |error| <= 1.0 ADX point and >= 90% of overlap rows
    within 5 points — stated here before the numbers are seen.

USAGE (control box, repo root)
    python3 tests/adx_reconstruct.py --db <path> --verify-only      # check first
    python3 tests/adx_reconstruct.py --db <path> --dry-run          # what would change
    python3 tests/adx_reconstruct.py --db <path> --apply            # write

Read-only unless --apply. Never touches a row that already has a real value.
