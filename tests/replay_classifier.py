"""Replay the CORRECTED sweep logic over tonight's 6 candle files.
Confirms: acceptance-through-a-level (AVGO 380+) is no longer a sweep, and
interior pokes with no named level (QQQ) are no longer sweeps. Uses the same
v3.0 — 2026-07-10 — repo-wide v3.0 bump: Yahoo-Finance purge & data stream
        mapping optimization (all market data now flows from the single
        shared TastyTrade candle feed — see data/candle_feed.py). No logic
        change in this file.
