tests/test_continuation_breakout.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-07

Pins CNT.1: standalone continuation may fire under BREAKOUT_VOLATILE, taking
direction from the trend engine's vote instead of from the label.

WHY THE TRADE WAS BARRED, which is the thing these tests protect: the bar was
STRUCTURAL, not a quality judgement. `continuation_strategy` derives direction
from the label — TRENDING_BULL -> long, TRENDING_BEAR -> short — and
BREAKOUT_VOLATILE asserts volatility EXPANSION while saying nothing about which
way, so there was no branch that could assign one. The runaway handoff already
solves the same problem by taking direction from the ORB.

THE RISK THIS OPENS, and why the ADX bar exists: under a non-trending label
`_label_trending` is False, so continuation's `CONTINUATION_CONV_FLOOR` check is
skipped entirely — the same hole the handoff path has. Falling back to
`regime.conviction` would be worse than nothing, because under BREAKOUT that is
BREAKOUT's conviction, not the trend's. Direction comes from the trend engine,
so the quality bar must too.
