tests/test_pitchfork_lifecycle.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-03.

§5 lifecycle tests. The properties here are the ones that make a fork a
PERSISTENT OBJECT rather than an indicator, and every one of them was violated
by the pre-lifecycle code path:

  HOLDS ACROSS BARS      §5.2 — "explicitly not recomputed each bar, each tick,
                         or each session". a2_rail_drift called build_fork per
                         bar and used only non-None returns, which is exactly the
                         per-bar-indicator behaviour §5.2 forbids.
  A TOUCH IS NOT DEATH   §5.2 — tagging the median or a tine is the TRADEABLE
                         EVENT the overlay exists to produce. "A fork that dies
                         when price touches it has inverted its own purpose."
  TREND-SIDE = LIFE      §5.3 — breaking the trend-side tine is ACCELERATION.
                         A bullish fork closing above its UML is understating the
                         move, not wrong. This is the single easiest thing to get
                         backwards: a naive "price left the channel, kill it"
                         rule kills forks on precisely the moves they called
                         correctly. Tested from BOTH directions so an inverted
                         sign cannot pass.
  COUNTER-SIDE = DEATH   §5.3(b) — but only after N consecutive closes beyond it
                         by >= D x ATR. One close is not enough.
  P0 BREAK = DEATH       §5.3(a) — the leg that defined the fork is gone.
  CHURN GUARD            §5.3(c) — supersession needs MATERIALLY different
                         geometry. Without the guard every marginal pivot
                         re-anchors and persistence evaporates, reintroducing the
                         very bug this module fixes.
  DETERMINISTIC          replay() must give byte-identical history on identical
                         bars, or tracker state stops being a cache of something
                         recomputable and starts being load-bearing.
