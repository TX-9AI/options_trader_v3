tests/test_condor_pitchfork_anchor.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-13   (PF.5)

The operator's spec is three filters and an ordering rule, and every test here
exists because one of them can fail silently:

  1. beyond the RAIL          — "just outside the range of the rail"
  2. beyond the MIN DISTANCE  — the surviving 0.80*EM floor
  3. NOT EXCEEDED by price    — beyond the session extreme
  then: MOST LIQUID among survivors, tie-break NEAREST the rail
  and:  leg order from the apparent SLOPE, flat falls back to proximity

⚠️ THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE SHIPPED BROKEN. `_liquidity_rank` replaces an
`open_interest + volume` sum that factor_sweep found CONSTANT across the whole
joined sample — so `max_liq` was 0, the `else: top = eligible` branch took every
call, and "most liquid" silently resolved to "nearest the floor" from
v-dualfloor onward. A test that only checks the happy path with populated OI
would pass against the broken version too, so the suite asserts the ranking
works with OI and volume BOTH ZERO — the state the fleet is actually in.
