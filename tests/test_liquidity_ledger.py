tests/test_liquidity_ledger.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-13

The operator's rule is the whole specification: *"the wick counts as a touch,
but only a close counts as acceptance or rejection."* Every test below exists
because that sentence has three distinct outcomes per bar and a naive
implementation collapses them into two.

THE FAILURE THIS SUITE EXISTS TO PREVENT: counting a bar that never reached the
level as a HOLD. That is how a level price never went near starts looking
defended, and it would make every floor in the book look strong.

DELIBERATE-FAILURE CHECKS INCLUDED AND RUN — a fixture that cannot go red is
not evidence.
