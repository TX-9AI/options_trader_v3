tests/test_liq_named_pools.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-11

Pins LIQ.1 + SWP.4 — the three defects that zeroed the SWEEP setup score on
textbook raids. All three were found by running the REAL code over a fabricated
tape carrying an engineered PDL sweep; none was visible in production logs,
because every relevant refusal path logs at DEBUG against a fleet on INFO.

WHAT EACH GUARD PROTECTS, and why each failure is SILENT:

1. **LONDON/ASIA AS SWEEPABLE POOLS.** London runs 07:00-16:00 UTC against RTH
   13:30-20:00 — a 2.5 HOUR OVERLAP — so from 09:30 to 12:00 ET "London High"
   is set by the price being traded right now. Sweeping it is sweeping a level
   RTH just made. Nothing errors; the sweep simply means nothing. It also
   explains the shadow observer's 61.3% London share: London was NEAREST
   because it TRACKED PRICE.

2. **THE DEDUPE TIEBREAK.** A PDH/PDL almost always also sits on an
   equal-high/low cluster, so one raid makes two sweeps with identical kind,
   pool_price and bars_ago. They collide on the dedupe key; `mins < cmins` is
   FALSE on equality, so the first-inserted won — and unnamed pools are found
   first. Result: `swept_named_level` EMPTY, `veto_loc` hard-veto, SWEEP SCORE
   EXACTLY 0.000 on a perfect raid. Measured 0.000 -> 1.000 with the fix.

3. **THE RECOVERY ANCHOR.** Measured from the wick extreme, a DEEPER rejection
   made the entry look FARTHER away — the gate penalised the quality it should
   reward. Anchored to the reclaimed LEVEL it reads 0.11% instead of 2.4%.

Deliberate-failure check performed when written: reverting the tiebreak to
`mins < cmins` turns test_named_sweep_survives_the_dedupe red; restoring the
wick anchor turns test_recovery_is_anchored_to_the_level red.
