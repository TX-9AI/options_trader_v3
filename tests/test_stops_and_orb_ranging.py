tests/test_stops_and_orb_ranging.py — the two operator changes, pinned. v1.0
v1.0 — 2026-08-19 — INITIAL. Mirrored from options_trader_smc, scoped to the
       strategies this repo has (no ICT suite here). The two changes ship to
       BOTH repos on the same day because the fork and this fleet are an A/B:
       moving the premium floor or ORB's regime permission on one arm only
       would make every subsequent difference between them unattributable.

Two changes that are one constant and one branch, which is exactly why they
need tests: both are the kind of edit a later refactor reverts without anyone
noticing, and neither raises when wrong.

  A. THE PREMIUM FLOOR IS 25%, NOT 40%, and it reaches every exit that
     inherits it — `stop_hit` on sweep AND on the ICT suite, `hard_stop` on
     ORB, and the ADOPTED stops via ADOPTED_STOP_PCT. Asserted as a DECISION:
     a trade at -30% must now exit and a trade at -20% must not. Asserting the
     constant alone would pass even if nothing read it.
     Butterfly (own 0.25), condor (CONDOR_STOP_LOSS_PCT) and continuation
     (0.15) must be UNTOUCHED — they never read this constant, and a change
     that quietly moved them would be a different experiment.

  B. ORB DOES NOT FIRE UNDER RANGING, and the refusal is JOURNALED. The
     journal half matters as much as the block: without a row, "ORB did not
     set up" and "ORB was forbidden" are indistinguishable in the record, and
     only one of those is a decision we can audit or reverse. Checked by AST
     so the RANGING branch is proven to sit BEFORE the permissive
     ORB_FIRES_REGARDLESS_OF_REGIME clause — order is the property; a block
     placed after it would be dead code that still looks correct.

Run:  cd <repo> && PYTHONPATH=. python3 tests/test_stops_and_orb_ranging.py
Deliberate-failure proof: OT_STOPS_SELFTEST=1 asserts the OLD 40% behaviour;
case A must go red.
