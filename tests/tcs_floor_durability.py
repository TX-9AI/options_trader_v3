tests/tcs_floor_durability.py — v1.2 — 2026-08-04   (backlog TC.4b prerequisite)

v1.2 — 2026-08-04 — TERMINAL OUTCOME + THE STRIKE-DISTANCE CURVE, because v1.1
        answered a question the trade does not ask. "Did a 1m close EVER go back
        through the floor before the bell?" is an INTRADAY VIOLATION rate. A
        defined-risk 0DTE spread does not lose when the level is touched; it
        loses on WHERE PRICE SITS AT THE BELL. A floor breached at 10:04 and
        reclaimed by 15:00 expires fine, and v1.1 counted it as a failure.
        So v1.2 reports BOTH and never merges them:
          - INTRADAY (v1.1's number) — how often the level was violated at all.
            Still the honest test of the premise AS STATED, and still the number
            that says whether the impulse origin is respected.
          - TERMINAL — the close nearest 15:45 relative to the floor. This is the
            one that maps to money.
          - RECOVERY — violated intraday, fine at the bell. The gap between the
            two rates IS the answer to "is the premise wrong, or is the strike
            just too close?"
          - THE STRIKE CURVE — terminal failure rate as a function of distance
            BEYOND the floor. That curve is the short-strike selector: it says
            how far OTM the spread has to sit for terminal failure to reach a
            tolerance you choose, priced from the state's own behaviour rather
            than from a delta.
        No new collection: same journal, same tape, same join.

v1.1 — 2026-08-04 — `--machine ARMED` (and `--min-r`), BECAUSE v1.0's FIRST RUN
        MEASURED THE WRONG POPULATION. It scored every floor the track ever
        computed — the impulse lookback rolls on EVERY tick, so most of those
        floors belong to moments when readiness was DORMANT and the strategy
        would never have sold anything. 5,129 "impulses" is the count of
        distinct floors observed, not of setups. The durability of a floor the
        trade would never have used answers no question anyone asked. The
        journal already carries `machine` (DORMANT / STAGING / ARMED) and `r`,
        so the filter costs nothing and the default is now ARMED.
        v1.0's numbers are SUPERSEDED, not merely refined: they are a different
        population and must not be compared to a filtered run.

DOES THE IMPULSE FLOOR HOLD? That is the entire premise of the trend credit
spread — sell a spread BEYOND the impulse candle, on the claim that committed
order flow will not fully retrace it. No engine exists yet, deliberately: TC.4b
says this table runs FIRST, because if the floor does not hold the strategy is
wrong and the firing engine is wasted work.

WHAT IT ASKS, per armed impulse:
    the readiness track recorded floor_px at time T.
    Between T and the session close, did a 1-MINUTE CLOSE go back through it?

CLOSE, not wick, and that is a real choice rather than a convenience. A short
strike is not taken out by a touch; it is threatened by acceptance beyond the
level. The wick statistic is reported ALONGSIDE (max penetration in ATR-free
percent) because it is what a stop would have felt, but the headline durability
number is close-based. Both are printed so the two are never conflated.

WHAT IT OUTPUTS, and each line answers a different open question:
  1. DURABILITY BY SD BUCKET — survival rate per impulse-magnitude tier. This IS
     the fit for TR_TCS_IMPULSE_SD_LO/HI: the bound belongs where durability
     starts clearing, not where a prior guessed. Feeds TC.4b (Aug 8-9).
  2. PENETRATION DISTRIBUTION — how far past the floor price actually traded on
     the failures. p90 is a STRIKE-DISTANCE rule priced from the state's own
     behaviour, the same argument AQ made for the condor on a strategy that
     wants it.
  3. TIME-TO-FAILURE — a floor that breaks at 15:55 is a different animal from
     one that breaks in four minutes, and only the second invalidates the trade.

DISCIPLINE, inherited rather than reinvented:
  - Cells under MIN_N are REFUSED, never read (a2_partition's rule).
  - The minimum detectable effect is printed, so an underpowered cell is never
    mistaken for a null (gap_outcome_join's lesson).
  - This is NOT a backtest and NOT a P&L claim. No spread is priced, no credit
    is assumed, no fill is modelled. It reports what the underlying did after a
    state the fleet already records.

Read-only. stdlib only. Runs on control, needs no boxes.
