tests/pitchfork_prior_sweep.py — v1.1 — 2026-08-03

v1.1 — 2026-08-03 — +the PIVOT form, measured against the same criterion. v1.0
       swept N x D on §5.3(b) as WRITTEN and returned NO SETTING CLEARS THE BAR:
       adverse-tine went 88.9% -> 56.5% across the whole grid while deaths barely
       moved (27 -> 23). That is the signature of a rule wrong in FORM, so
       lifecycle v1.2 added `adverse_mode="pivot"` — invalidate on a CONFIRMED
       PIVOT beyond the counter tine rather than on N consecutive closes.
       It was built but never measured, which left the whitepaper asserting the
       written form is broken while offering an untested replacement. This closes
       that: pivot rows run under the SAME pre-registered criterion, so the two
       forms are comparable rather than merely both present.
       PIVOT MODE IGNORES N — it counts no consecutive closes — so it is swept on
       D alone and N is shown as "-".

WHAT N AND D SHOULD BE FOR THE HOURLY FORK — with the criterion fixed BEFORE the
numbers are looked at.

THE FINDING THAT PROMPTED THIS
    pitchfork_filter_audit v1.3 on the real tape, 29 symbols:
        CAUSE OF DEATH   24 (88.9%) adverse tine     3 (11.1%) structural (P0)
        LIFETIME         min 2   p50 5   p90 27   max 53   (hourly bars)
        COVERAGE         10.1% mean, 5.3% median, 0.0% min
    A p50 of five hourly bars is under one session. §5.2 expects a persistent
    object to survive far longer, and §5.3(a) calls structural break "the
    strongest and cleanest condition" — yet it accounts for 11% of deaths while a
    threshold accounts for 89%.
    **The anchors are fine. Structural breaks are RARE, so the underlying
    P0/P1/P2 structures are durable — it is the KILL RULE ending them.**

WHY THE PRIOR IS WRONG RATHER THAN THE TAPE
    §5.3(b) gives "Start N = 2, D = 0.25" with NO TIMEFRAME QUALIFIER. Two
    consecutive DAILY closes 0.25 ATR beyond a rail is a real structural event.
    Two consecutive HOURLY closes is an ordinary pullback — roughly two hours of
    drift against the channel. The prior was not mis-specified so much as applied
    at a timeframe it was never scaled for, which is the same shape as every
    other finding this week: a value that was fine where it was written and wrong
    where it was used.

THE CRITERION, PRE-REGISTERED — read this before the table
    §10 names the ten-parameter surface as a headline overfitting risk, so
    "sweep until coverage looks good" is exactly the failure mode to avoid.
    Coverage is therefore NOT the target. The paper supplies a better one:

        §5.3(a) calls structural break the STRONGEST and CLEANEST condition.
        A healthy fork should die mostly THAT way.

    So the pre-registered rule is: **choose the SMALLEST (N, D) at which
    adverse-tine ceases to be the dominant cause of death — adverse share below
    50%.** Smallest, not best: the loosest setting that clears the bar, because
    every further loosening buys coverage by declining to invalidate, which is
    not the same as the fork being right.

    Two guards on that:
      - If NO setting in the grid clears 50%, do not pick the best of a bad grid.
        That result means the adverse-tine rule is wrong in FORM rather than in
        magnitude, and the answer is a different condition, not a bigger number.
      - Coverage is reported alongside but must not drive the choice. If the
        chosen setting also happens to maximise coverage, that is a coincidence
        to note, not a justification.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO
    It does not change a default. It prints a table and names the setting the
    criterion selects. Changing §5.3's priors is a separate, deliberate act — and
    per AW the hourly fork is not on the critical path anyway, so there is no
    reason to rush it. The DAILY fork is where these priors were always meant to
    live, and it does not exist yet (AP).
