tests/test_candle_feed_once_exempt.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-04

Pins candle_feed v3.10: `--once` is exempt from BOTH RTH gates.

WHY SOURCE-LEVEL. Exercising `run()` needs a TastyTrade session, a DXLink
streamer and a live event loop; standing those up would test the mocks. The
change is two boolean conditions and they are the whole of it — and the failure
they caused was invisible at every level a normal test looks: no exception, no
non-zero exit, an INFO line reading `Feed idle — outside RTH`, and a 38-byte
CSV where a 16 KB one belonged. It cost two sessions of sat-out tape before
anyone read the box log, and DXFeed history is same-evening only, so it is
permanent.

THE SECOND GATE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. The RTH-over break inside the stream
loop sits ABOVE the `--once` drain-exit, so fixing only the outer gate reproduces
the identical hang one layer down with the backfill still undrained. A test that
checked one condition would have passed a broken fix.
