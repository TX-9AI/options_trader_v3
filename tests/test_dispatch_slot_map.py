tests/test_dispatch_slot_map.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-14

THE SLOT MAP, AS SPECIFIED BY THE OPERATOR 2026-08-14, ENFORCED STRUCTURALLY.

    BEFORE 11:00  ORB owns 09:35-11:00. A RUNAWAY is the one condition that
                  frees the slot — it is SLOT ARBITRATION, not anchoring. The
                  freed slot goes to `trend_continuation_handoff` FIRST
                  (dispatch order), and to SweepReversal only on a NAMED level.

    AFTER 11:00   ORB / Continuation / Sweep are ALL blocked (AFD.1 — every one
                  is debit directional). The afternoon is three non-overlapping
                  regimes with one occupant each:
                      condor    RANGING + a live daily pitchfork
                      butterfly 12:00-14:00 + PINNING GEX
                      TC.6      directional trend vote, everything else
                  TC.6 defers when a condor plan holds the symbol.

⚠️ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT, found by auditing the paths on
2026-08-14: **AFD.1 was a POST-SELECTION veto.** It ran AFTER every strategy had
been evaluated, so past 11:00 a debit strategy still WON the slot — `signal`
went non-None, TC.6 (which sits behind `if signal is None`) never ran, and only
then was the debit signal refused. **The tick produced no trade at all and the
slot the spec assigns to TC.6 was consumed by a strategy forbidden to trade in
it.** Placing the gate after selection was right for JOURNALLING and wrong for
ARBITRATION.

These are SOURCE-ORDER assertions because the failure is positional. No unit
test of `_afternoon_debit_blocked` could have caught it — the predicate was
always correct; it was simply called too late.
