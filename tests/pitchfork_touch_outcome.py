DOES PRICE REACT AT A RAIL? The one question the hourly fork can actually be
asked, and the only thing it produced in quantity.

WHY THIS AND NOT MORE FORK PLUMBING
    §5.2 is explicit: "tagging the median or either tine is NOT invalidation —
    those are the TRADEABLE EVENTS the whole overlay exists to produce." Every
    other measurement this week has been about the fork's internals. This is the
    first one about whether the fork is worth anything.
    It is also the highest-yield thing available without waiting for the daily
    series (AP): the hourly fork produced **162 TOUCH events against 33 births**.
    Touches are the abundant output; births are the scarce one.

WHAT AW ESTABLISHED THAT CONSTRAINS THE READING
    The hourly fork is NOT a level — coverage 10.1% mean / 5.3% median, median
    life ~9 bars, exceeded on the trend side 22 times in 33 births, and NO
    variant/N/D combination in the sweep produced a fork that both persists and
    contains price. So a touch here is a touch on an object that price is often
    outside of. A positive result would be surprising and would need replication
    on the daily fork before it meant anything; a null is the expected outcome and
    is not evidence against the DAILY fork, which is a different instrument.

THE THREE RAILS ARE THREE HYPOTHESES, never pooled
    upper   — resistance in a bullish fork, support in a bearish one
    median  — Andrews' mean-reversion anchor, the claim 2b already tested and
              found null over minute horizons (r² ~ 0.001)
    lower   — support in a bullish fork, resistance in a bearish one
    And APPROACH SIDE splits each again: a rail tagged from BELOW and one tagged
    from ABOVE are opposite trades. Pooling would average a bounce against a
    rejection and report zero for both.

THE OUTCOME IS SIGNED BY WHAT THE RAIL PREDICTS, not by direction
    "React at the rail" means price turns AWAY from it. For a bullish fork's
    LOWER rail touched from above, that is a move UP. For its UPPER rail touched
    from below, that is a move DOWN. So each instance is signed by its own
    expected reaction and a positive mean means the rails held.
    Against a matched CONTROL: bars in the SAME fork with no touch, same symbol.
    Without the control this measures hourly drift, not the rail.

POWER FIRST — read it before the table
    n=162 across three rails and two approach sides is ~27 per cell before any
    horizon split. The trade-level work this week established the discipline: a
    cell too small to resolve a plausible effect is UNDERPOWERED, not null, and
    labelling it null is the error that made a confounded condor split look real.
    So the minimum detectable effect is printed per cell and cells under n=20 are
    REFUSED outright.
