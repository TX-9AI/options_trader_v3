# v2.5 - 2026-08-15 - `--last N`, `--from`, `--to` SELECT FILES BEFORE READING.
#        ⚠️ v2.4's `--last` loaded EVERY matched log and trimmed dates
#        afterwards. 25 sessions is ~280k records held at once, and on the
#        control box that was SILENTLY OOM-KILLED - no output, no traceback, no
#        non-zero message the operator could act on. A date range is a FILE
#        SELECTION, not a post-filter. Also prints `[files] N matched` so a run
#        that reads nothing says so.
# v2.4 - 2026-08-15 - `--grid` and `--sweeps`, and records are DATE-TAGGED.
#        THE GRID is symbols down / dates across, one dominant-regime code per
#        cell (TL TB RG BO CP SW), with `*` marking a cell that clears L1.7's
#        TRENDING bar. A trend day is now a glance instead of a query.
#        ⚠️ DATE TAGGING WAS REQUIRED FIRST: saved records carry `ts` as HH:MM
#        only, so a multi-file scan would have BLENDED a symbol's trend day into
#        its chop days and diluted exactly what is being looked for. The date
#        comes from the filename.
#        `--sweeps` answers "was a previously NAMED pool actually swept during
#        the session" - the scorer already writes `named`, `reclaimed`,
#        `pool_price`, `kind` and `age_bars` into `breakdown`, so this reads
#        history rather than collecting anything. It prints the decay shape
#        after the peak and marks a row TIER-B CANDIDATE only when all three of
#        L1.7's conditions hold: SWEEP>0 at the bar, a reclaim, and a monotone
#        decay. A high max score alone is a LEAD, never a pass.
# v2.3 - 2026-08-15 - PER-SYMBOL VIEW. `--symbol SYM`, `--by-symbol`, and
#        `--report-only` now takes MULTIPLE files (or a glob) for a date range.
#        WHY: L1.7's acceptance criteria are written PER SYMBOL-DAY ("one
#        genuine trend day showing TRENDING_* dominant ~50%"), but every report
#        in this suite aggregated ~29 symbol-sessions - and blending them
#        GUARANTEES no regime dominates, because different symbols are in
#        different regimes on the same day. A perfect trend day on QQQ was
#        averaged against 28 others. **So the four "tape gaps" were never
#        testable, and the qualifying days may already be on disk.**
#        Demonstrated: the same 400 ticks show nothing dominant in aggregate and
#        TRENDING_BEAR at 70% dominance filtered to one symbol.
#        `--symbol` filters at the PATH for a live replay (one file per symbol,
#        so ~29x faster and the normal report comes out per-symbol with no
#        special casing) and at the RECORD for `--report-only`, where saved tick
#        logs are already merged and there are no paths left to filter.
#        `--by-symbol` ranks every symbol by TRENDING_* dominance so a whole
#        archive is SCANNED rather than checked one symbol at a time.
#        Default behaviour with no flags is unchanged.
# tests/replay_confluence.py — options_trader_v3 — v2.3
# v2.3 — 2026-08-04 — the emitted-distribution line collapsed TRENDING_BULL and
#         TRENDING_BEAR into one token ("TREND") — the same defect found in the
#         diary, on the line the Aug 10-21 freeze watch reads nightly. Uses
#         utils/regime_labels.label(). Display only.
# v2.2 — 2026-08-01 — FRAME CAPS FROM CONFIG, so the replay sees exactly what
#         LIVE sees. The as-of slices were UNCAPPED — every warm session added
#         history no live engine would ever receive, and the divergence grew with
#         --warm-sessions. It became load-bearing the moment we decided to wake
#         the 15m vote and leave 1h asleep (config v4.1): at warm >= 7 the
#         replay's 1h frame reaches 55+ bars and VOTES, while live holds it at 50
#         and it stays NEUTRAL. The offline corpus would have carried a
#         directional vote production does not have.
#         Each resampled frame is now trimmed to TIMEFRAMES[tf]["candles"], the
#         same number data_cache passes to fetch_candles. Warm depth then only has
#         to FILL the caps and anything beyond is inert — so the default moves
#         5 -> 8, enough for a 150-bar 15m frame (~5.8 sessions) with margin.
#         WHY 5 WAS WRONG: nothing in the chain ever passed --warm-sessions
#         (regime_backfill invoked this module without it), so every diary,
#         backfill and a2_characterise run has been at 5 — which starves the 15m
#         frame the calibration now depends on.
#         MEASURED, so the cap is not assumed to be free: ADX-14 on 5m is
#         insensitive to depth past ~100 bars (identical to 2dp at 104/130/156
#         bars), and bb_width_pct / atr_avg_20 are bounded-lookback by
#         construction (BB-20, mean of last 20 ATR values) so extra frame length
#         is unreachable to them. structure_sequence reads the whole frame and is
#         the one engine that could shift — watch it first if a regen surprises.
#         CONSEQUENCE: corpus numbers built before this are not comparable. The
#         4.02% A2 rate and the 45%-in-the-10:00-hour concentration are superseded.
# v2.1 — 2026-08-01 — THE BOOKMARK WAS WARMING THE 1m FRAME TOO, AND 1m IS THE ONE
#         FRAME LIVE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT WARM. v1.2 prepended prior sessions to
#         df1m so the RESAMPLED 5m/15m/1h would carry ADX/EMA history — correct, and
#         still the point. But `s1m` was then sliced out of that same concatenated
#         frame, so the 25-bar 1-minute close window handed to the scorer straddled
#         the overnight gap for the first 25 bars of every replayed session.
#         market_data v3.1 session-scopes 1m ONLY, on purpose ("no overnight
#         padding"); tests/test_market_data_contract.py asserts that contract on the
#         LIVE path. The replay violated the same contract, so:
#           • live has < 25 one-minute bars until ~09:55 → passes closes=None →
#             RANGING and COMPRESSION are NOT SCORED for the first 25 minutes;
#           • replay scored both from 09:30, off a gap-spanning regression.
#         Measured on a synthetic two-session fixture through this same code path:
#         at the target day's first bar, 24 of the 25 window bars belonged to the
#         PRIOR session and a -1.14 gap sat inside the regression.
#         FIX: df1m stays warm for the RESAMPLE (unchanged, that is the bookmark);
#         `s1m` is now scoped to the target session, and `closes` is built exactly
#         as main.py:551 builds it — None below RANGE_WINDOW_BARS. HTF warming is
#         untouched. Consequence to know when reading old artifacts: RANGING /
#         COMPRESSION counts in the opening 25 minutes DROP to None, matching live;
#         any acceptance or characterisation number computed over the old corpus
#         included ticks live could never have produced.
# v2.0 — 2026-07-12 — LAYER-2 TRACKS + drift merge.
#   (a) MERGE: absorbs the control-box local mod (--report-only: rebuild + reprint
#       the full report from a saved tick-log JSONL; no engines, no re-scoring)
#       that never reached GitHub — ends the two-way drift where the repo had
#       v1.1's sibling-skip and control had report-only, neither had both.
#   (b) LAYER-2: each symbol-session's per-tick evidence vector is now ALSO fed,
#       in time order, through a fresh ConvictionIntegrator (v2.0, always-argmax).
#       Every JSONL record gains an "l2" object {regime, c, stale, cv[, trigger]}
#       and the report gains a LAYER-2 section: emitted-label distribution,
#       label SWITCHES per symbol-session vs L1-argmax flips (the churn metric
#       the integrator exists to crush), and stale%. Purely additive: CLI args,
#       exit codes (0 pass / 2 acceptance-fail), and every existing JSONL field
#       are unchanged — regime_diary/regime_backfill/validate_regime.sh work
#       as-is; L2 report prints only when l2 fields are present (old logs
#       reprint cleanly under --report-only). Layer-1 acceptance checks remain
#       the sole exit-code authority; L2 is observational until L2 targets land.
# v1.2 — 2026-07-21 — ADX-WARMUP BOOKMARK. Prepend up to --warm-sessions (default 5)
#         prior sessions of the same symbol's 1m tape before resampling, so 5m/15m/1h
#         carry enough history to warm ADX-14 / the 50-EMA from the target day's FIRST
#         scored tick. Prior bars feed the engines but are never scored or logged (the
#         tick loop starts at the target day's open). Fixes the replay-only defect where
#         ADX stayed 0.0 until ~14:00 — trend-blind every morning — mislabeling genuine
#         trend days as CHOP (AAPL 2026-07-21: true 5m ADX peaked 52, replay logged 0
#         until 14:00). The LIVE engine was already warm (feed store retains 400 5m bars
#         ≈ 5 days); this gives the replay the same reach-back. --warm-sessions 0 restores
#         the old single-day behaviour.
# v1.1 — 2026-07-11 — skip non-OHLC siblings in harvest folders (fleet_trades_*.csv,
#         *_trades_*.db, daily_trades_*.json) that share data/harvest/<date>/ with the
#         tape; load_ohlc returns None on a missing timestamp column. v1.0 crashed at
#         the report step on the consolidated fleet_trades CSV. No scoring-logic change.
#   Layer-1 VALIDATION + CALIBRATION harness. Replays analysis/regime_confluence.py
#   over the candle logger's DXFeed 1-min OHLC (data/OHLC/<date>/<SYMBOL>.csv) — the
#   traded tape, store-consistent per ROADMAP. NOT the shadow observer jsonl —
#   not because the observer is a different feed (it is not; see REPLAY_VALIDATION
#   v1.1) but because its sampling is tick-cadenced and staleness-gated, where
#   calibration needs deterministic, evenly-spaced 1-min bars.
#
#   Method: AS-OF replay. For each 1-min bar t of the session, slice every timeframe
#   frame to bars ≤ t, run the REAL engines (volatility/trend/structure/liquidity —
#   the same code the live bot runs), then score the resulting states with the real
#   RegimeConfluenceScorer. Optionally logs the v1.3 boolean regime for comparison.
#
#   Emits: (1) per-regime score distributions, (2) per-FACTOR distributions split by
#   the v1.3 label (the calibration gold — e.g. flat-angle on RANGING vs TRENDING
#   ticks), (3) the Layer-1 acceptance checks (see REPLAY_VALIDATION.md). No Layer-2
#   behavior is invoked — this validates instantaneous scores only.
#
#   Run (on-box, repo root):  python -m tests.replay_confluence data/OHLC/2026-07-13
#         or specific files:   python -m tests.replay_confluence path/to/SPX.csv ...
#         options:  --jsonl out.jsonl   --warmup 20   --no-v13
#
#   Isolation: reads OHLC + runs engines only. Places no orders, opens no trades.db,
#   writes only the report (+ optional --jsonl). Safe to run anytime.

    resampled 5m/15m/1h frames carry enough history to warm ADX-14 / the 50-EMA
    from the target day's FIRST tick.

    Why: the live engine reads a rolling multi-session window from the feed store
    (5m retained 400 bars ≈ 5 days), so live ADX is warm at 09:30. The replay
    resampled 5m from a SINGLE day-file, so its ADX stayed 0.0 until ~14:00 —
    every replayed morning was trend-blind, and the diary mislabeled genuine
    trend days as CHOP. This gives the replay the same reach-back the live store
    already has. Prior bars WARM the engines; they are never scored or logged
    (the tick loop still starts at the target day's open — see replay_symbol).

    Layout: data/OHLC/<date>/<SYMBOL>_ohlc_<date>.csv. We walk sibling date
    folders older than the target and collect this symbol's files. After-hours /
    gaps are fine — ADX only needs continuous *bars*, not continuous *time*.
    Missing prior days are skipped silently (a fresh deployment simply warms

    # one, so a tick scoring both high is not a contradiction. It is a slow
