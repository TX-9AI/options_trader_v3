tests/test_exit_latency.py — v1.0 — 2026-08-04 (N.5)

Proves the exit-ladder latency capture through the REAL `place_exit_order` seam
and a REAL sqlite trades table. The paper path is exercised end to end; the live
path's multi-tick accumulation is exercised through the same public seam by
driving the record state the live loop maintains, because standing up a broker
session in a unit test would test the mock, not the ladder.

The load-bearing assertions are the two that describe how this capture can be
WRONG rather than absent:
  - an UNCONFIRMED pass must write nothing and must NOT reset the submit
    instant, or every slow close reports only its fast final leg;
  - `exit_mark_at_trigger` must be the mark the exit DECISION saw, not the
    price it eventually filled at — in paper they coincide, and that
    coincidence is the plumbing proof, not a result.

Deliberate-failure check performed when written: stamping `_exit_submit_ts` on
every pass (instead of only the first) turns
test_unconfirmed_pass_does_not_restart_the_clock red; writing on an unconfirmed
result turns test_unconfirmed_close_writes_nothing red.
