v1.7 — 2026-08-18 — TIE RATE AND UNIQUE-VALUE COUNT, because a small Cliff's
    delta has TWO very different causes and they call for opposite conclusions.
    Tied pairs count as neither greater nor lesser, so **CROSS-ARM ties deflate
    delta** — a primitive whose nf and ok arms draw from the SAME values scores
    near zero however sharply it separates elsewhere. (Ties WITHIN an arm do
    not: nf pinned at 0.0 against ok pinned at 1.0 scores +0.996.)
    `direction_conf` came back gap **+0.257** with delta **+0.09** — that is
    either genuine distributional overlap or a coverage artifact, and the two
    mean opposite things for the retool. `ties` and `uniq` make it answerable
    instead of arguable.
v1.7 — 2026-08-18 — THE CRITERION NOW MATCHES WHAT IT ADVERTISES.
    ⚠️ TWO DEFECTS IN MY OWN PRE-REGISTERED CRITERION, FOUND BY READING THE
    RESULT RATHER THAN THE CODE:
    (1) **"CI-separated" WAS ADVERTISED AND NEVER IMPLEMENTED.** `_wilson` was
        computed on every row and THROWN AWAY; `clears` tested sign, n, sessions
        and stability only. A clause promised in the header and absent from the
        code is the same class as a test that asserts source text instead of
        executing — committed by the tool built to enforce that discipline.
    (2) **NO EFFECT SIZE AT ALL.** `IV skew vs atm` was reported as CLEARS on a
        gap of **+0.001** against a median of 0.016, alongside `direction_conf`
        at **+0.257** against ~0.75. Raw median gaps are not comparable across
        primitives on different scales, so "clears" was being awarded to noise.
    NOW: Mann-Whitney U (rank-based — these distributions are bounded,
    zero-inflated and plainly non-normal; BREAKOUT's nf median is exactly 0.000)
    AND Cliff's delta with a floor at 0.147, the conventional
    negligible/small boundary. Both are PRINTED per row, not just tested.
    ⚠️ p ALONE IS NOT A LICENCE: on ~840 observations a p-value will call a
    trivial difference significant. Significance answers "is it real", delta
    answers "is it worth anything", and this tool previously asked NEITHER.
v1.6 — 2026-08-18 — SORT KEY. v1.4 crashed on the real corpus with
    `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict'`: a
    bare `.sort()` on (time, dict) tuples falls through to comparing the DICTS
    whenever two snapshots share a minute — and they do. **It only fires on a
    TIE, so my fixture with distinct timestamps passed and the fleet data did
    not.** Now sorts on the timestamp alone.
v1.5 — 2026-08-18 — AS-OF JOIN. v1.3 keyed the chain on `HH:MM` EQUALITY and
    threw away ~79% of the data it already had: snapshots land every ~5 minutes
    (76 across a 390-minute session), trades fire at arbitrary minutes, so exact
    matching caught only trades that fired ON a snapshot minute — **183 of 874,
    exactly the ~20% a 1-in-5 coincidence predicts.** The IV rows came back
    UNDER-POWERED at n=192 and the data was never thin; **the join was wrong.**
    ⚠️ The operator offered to increase snapshot frequency. Declined: more data
    would have PAPERED OVER the defect rather than fixed it, and the corpus is
    already four weeks deep.
    ⚠️ AS-OF IS ALSO THE CORRECT SEMANTICS, not just a wider net — at 10:17 the
    trader knew the 10:15 surface. Taking a LATER snapshot would leak
    information from after the decision, which is the exact error this retool
    exists to eliminate. PRECEDING only, with a 30-minute staleness bound
    (`--chain-max-age-min`): a stale surface is worse than none.
v1.4 — 2026-08-17 — THE IV SURFACE. The only genuinely FORWARD-LOOKING input
    class in the stack: every other primitive here is computed from bars that
    have already printed, while implied volatility is the market's own PRICED
    EXPECTATION of what is coming. If the retool's premise is reachable at all,
    this is the most likely place it lives — and it has never been tested.
    FEATURES (delta-anchored, not strike-anchored — 25-delta is the same
    statement about tail pricing on a $76 symbol and a $7,700 one):
      · IV atm (level) · IV 25d risk-reversal (put IV over call IV; POSITIVE =
        the market is paying up for downside) · IV skew vs atm.
    ⚠️ 0DTE ONLY, VERIFIED: every snapshot carries a SINGLE expiry equal to the
    session date, so calendar skew and term slope are NOT computable and are
    not attempted.
    ⚠️ GEX IS NOT RE-DERIVED. `data/gex_data.py` already computes net GEX, the
    walls and the pin from these same contracts and is a LIVE consumer; a second
    lineage would violate §7. Only the IV shape — which nothing reads — is new.
    ⚠️ CORPUS: 21 dates, 117 MB, 07-20 → 08-17, snapshots only for boxes that
    WOKE. Every trade has one; no cross-sectional read is possible.
v1.3 — 2026-08-17 — UNDER-POWERED IS NOT FAILED, AND THE WINDOWS ARE SHOWN.
    ⚠️ v1.1 CONFLATED THEM AND PRINTED THE WRONG VERDICT. On the ORB-only run
    every row was n=156-178 against the 200 floor — the criterion NEVER GOT TO
    APPLY — and the tool announced "NOTHING CLEARS -> escalate to new inputs".
    **That is an absent measurement reported as a null result: the exact error
    §12 exists to prevent, committed by the tool built to enforce it.**
    NOW: no verdict is issued when nothing is powered. It states the shortfall,
    names how many more trades the leading candidate needs, and marks that
    leader a POINTER, not a result — an in-sample leader among under-powered
    candidates is not evidence.
    ALSO: a per-window split (pre-LIQ.1 · post-LIQ.1 · post-LIQ.6 · post-FEED.2)
    for the top candidates. A separator living in ONE window is a regime
    artifact and the pooled median hides it.
tests/separation_probe.py — v1.2 — 2026-08-17   (P0.1 — THE GATE)

v1.1 — 2026-08-17 — OOM FIX + TWO GLOB EXCLUSIONS.
    v1.0 built a dict of EVERY tick across EVERY replay log before touching a
    trade — ~282k parsed JSON records held at once — and was **KILLED (rc=137)**
    on control, the same failure the regime grid hit on 08-15.
    ⚠️ AND THE LOUD "ABSENT MEASUREMENT" GUARD COULD NOT FIRE: the process died
    before reaching it. **An in-process guard cannot report a kill** — which is
    why the first two runs printed nothing at all rather than a diagnosis.
    NOW: the trade list is built FIRST, and only the (date, sym, HH:MM) keys
    those trades need are indexed. MEASURED: 282,750 ticks scanned, 2 indexed,
    **13 MB peak RSS**.
    ALSO: `_archive_pre_*` directories and `.bak` files live inside the trades
    tree and were being globbed as real data.

**DOES ANYTHING ALREADY COLLECTED SEPARATE FAVOURABLE FROM NEVER-FAVOURABLE
TRADES AT DECISION TIME?**

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY THIS IS THE GATE, AND WHY IT COMES FIRST
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The project's founding premise — infer a pattern *forming*, express it as a
confidence factor, and **scale the entry on it** — was never actually run.
`ROADMAP.md` §LAYER 3: **"Status: NOT STARTED. 0%"**. A proxy assembly ran
instead (grade → 1.5x size) and **inverted**: A-grade 399 trades **−$8,244**,
B-grade 220 trades **+$1,893**.

The two quantities the system DID gate and size on are measured dead:
  · `SETUP` — nf ≈ ok, and the grade inverted at size.
  · `RGCV`  — nf **1.00** vs ok **0.34** in RANGING (an ANTI-signal), 0.59 vs
    0.36 in COMPRESSION, and **1.00 vs 1.00 in trend** (no separation at all).
    Its own scorer header names the class error: *"High conviction means the
    trend is already obvious, which means LATE."*

**Every phase of TRANSITION_ROADMAP.md is conditional on this answer.** If a
primitive separates, the remaining work is WIRING. If nothing does — including
shadow velocity with four fleet-weeks — the escalation is NEW INPUTS, not a new
combiner, and that is worth knowing before anything is rebuilt.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PRE-REGISTERED SUCCESS CRITERION — written BEFORE the run, per §12
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A primitive is a candidate confidence factor **only if all four hold**:

    1. nf BELOW ok              (direction: the losers score lower)
    2. CI-separated             (Wilson 95% on the nf-rate at the extremes)
    3. n >= 200 across >= 10 sessions
    4. sign stable across at least the two post-LIQ.1 windows

⚠️ **NO BEST PRIMITIVE IS NAMED BY THIS TOOL.** In-sample argmax over a dozen
candidates is overfit by construction — trying twelve things and reporting the
best is a different experiment from testing one. This prints every candidate,
its n, and whether it CLEARS. The choice is a decision, made against the
criterion above, not an argmax.

⚠️ **AND A FAILING PRIMITIVE IS A RESULT.** `pair_conf` was killed this way
(AX.3) and that saved building on it. Reporting only winners would make this
tool a confirmation machine — the exact failure it exists to diagnose.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WINDOWS, EXCLUSIONS, AND WHY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚠️ THE ARCHIVE IS **FOUR REGIMES** for anything touching levels or sweeps:
    pre-LIQ.1 · post-LIQ.1 (08-12) · post-LIQ.6 (08-15) · post-FEED.2 (08-17)
Level-dependent primitives are NOT comparable across those boundaries; a
separator that flips sign across LIQ.6 is a level artifact, not a signal.
Velocity is level-agnostic and stays comparable.

⚠️ **2026-08-14 IS EXCLUDED** — 130 of 153 trades are identity-chain / CNT.1
artifacts. `trend_continuation_breakout` rows from 08-07 onward are one-tick
artifacts and are excluded regardless of date.

⚠️ READ-ONLY, CONTROL-SIDE. Touches no box, needs no bake. **The fleet must keep
trading and collecting through the retool** — the probe cannot be the thing that
interrupts it.
