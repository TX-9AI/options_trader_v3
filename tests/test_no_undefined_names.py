tests/test_no_undefined_names.py — v1.0 — 2026-07-30

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR — twice in two days, both caught by a live box crashing:

  2026-07-29  continuation_strategy v1.3 deleted the BB-midline block that defined
              `mid` and left four references, including the structural stop.
              NameError on EVERY tick. All 15 boxes took ZERO trades from the open
              until ~10:05 ET. The entire ORB window was missed.

  2026-07-30  butterfly_strategy reverted its proximity multiplier to a fixed
              1x EM, deleted `_mult`, and left the log line referencing it.
              NameError on every butterfly evaluation — but only a box in
              COMPRESSION reaches that gate, so IWM restarted twice while the
              other 14 boxes ran the identical code without a scratch.

Both are the same shape: a refactor removes a computation and leaves a reference
behind, on a path that only executes under conditions the test suite and most of
the fleet never hit. Python compiles it happily — an undefined name is a RUNTIME
error, so `python -c "import ast"` passes, the deploy gate passes, and the fault
waits for the one box that meets the condition.

Static analysis finds this in milliseconds. Neither incident needed to happen.

WHY THIS IS A TEST AND NOT A CANARY: check_versions greps for tokens that should
or should not be present; it cannot reason about scope. Pyflakes builds the
binding graph and answers the actual question — is this name reachable where it
is used.

ZERO TOLERANCE, deliberately. A quoted forward reference that pyflakes cannot
resolve is fixed with a TYPE_CHECKING import (see main.py) rather than
allow-listed, because the moment this gate has an exception list it starts
growing one and the third NameError ships.
